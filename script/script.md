Flutter: A Walk Up A Mahogony Staircase
=======================================

Prologue
--------

This talk is intended to explain Flutter's design. As such, it starts
from first principles and slowly walks up to the full design. This
means that, especially early in the talk, the code presented will not
be very ergonomic. If you're looking for a tutorial on how to use
Flutter, this is not it. Nor is it a comprehensive API description.

   This is a tutorial: https://flutter.io/tutorial/

   These are our API docs: http://docs.flutter.io/

   This is our Web site with more information: https://flutter.io/


Chapter 1: Let's create an app!
-------------------------------

Let's write a trivial app. It'll just show a table with my wishlist of
items I want from the MÃ¤rklin 2016 model train catalogue.

```
$ flutter create trains
```

Type type type.

<https://github.com/Hixie/mahogony-staircase/blob/master/apps/chapter1/trains/lib/main.dart>

```
$ flutter analyze
$ flutter run
```

Success!

Pros of this approach: There's only one code path.
Cons of this approach: You do a ton of work every frame.


Chapter 2: Adding more to the app
---------------------------------

Ok. Let's add a checkbox to the first cell of each row so that we can
track which one's I've preordered.

Chapter 3: Rendering library
----------------------------

Having to do all these calculations is ridiculous.

Let's use a library that provides render objects.

Side bar: Let's explain what's going on here.


Chapter 4: Adding more to the app
---------------------------------

Let's add the "checkbox" again.

<https://github.com/Hixie/mahogony-staircase/blob/master/apps/chapter4/trains/lib/main.dart>


Chapter 5: Widgets
------------------

Having to first build the app and then poke at it is error-prone.
Let's use a library that provides an abstraction over the render
objects so that you just build the app each time and it efficiently
redoes the layout only as needed.

![This is the third time I've written this app, and I'm getting exceedingly efficient at it.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZKpFFD7aX3c/maxresdefault.jpg)

Chapter 6: Adding more to the app
---------------------------------

Let's add the "checkbox" again.

Chapter 7: Stateful builder
---------------------------
